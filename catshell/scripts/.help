##  Scripts either cause problems when sourced (variable persistency, etc), or are non-bash scripts. (.py, etc)
##    so they are invoked via bash or python commands as aliases.
##  Catshell's init file should automatically create aliases for these,
##    assuming that they end in .sh for shell script files and .py for python scripts.
